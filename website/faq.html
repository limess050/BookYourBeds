			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>I am concerned that by using an online booking system I might lose some of the personal touch with my guests?</h3>

				<p>Offering your customers the ability to book with you easily is a service they want. </p>

				<p>What you can do to add the personal touch is email the clients directly either at the time of booking or at some point before they are due to arrive and add the personal touch then.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>What happens when I get to the end of the free trial? Am I tied in to a contract?</h3>

				<p>If you wish to close your account on completion of the free trial period you can as there are no tie ins or contracts with using bookyourbeds.com. Once you are a paying account holder and you wish to close your account we ask for 30 days notice to tie up any loose ends.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>I don’t have a payment gateway so what is your email confirmation system?</h3>

				<p>The email confirmation system is straightforward but clever and helps to safeguard against false bookings. The guest will get two emails from your system; the first asks for the guest to confirm that they are definitely staying, and the second is the final confirmation of their booking details. This is done to safeguard against false bookings.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>What if a visitor doesn’t confirm using the confirmation email?</h3>

				<p>There is a time limit on the confirmation link of 24 hours. If it is not activated the pending booking is cancelled and the room or beds are made available again.</p>

<p>The double check system is in place to try and prevent fraudulent bookings being made with you. It may sound a bit over the top but anything to help prevent fraudulent bookings is a good thing for the running of your business.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>I made a mistake in some of the details I entered when using the set up wizard, can I change these?</h3>

				<p>Yes you can very easily. Once your account is active you can amend any mistakes from within the system. Make sure you are happy with what you have set up before linking to your website, if you are changing the URL then remember that you will need to amend where your book now buttons link. If you are having problems just get in contact and we’ll help you, but there are guide notes within the system to help you along. </p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>Where is my information kept?</h3>

				<p>Your information is kept on our secure servers where only BookYourBeds.com staff, have access. </p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>How do you make sure that information being passed to my payment gateway is secure?</h3>

				<p>We have a security certificate that protects any information being transferred.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>What pictures would you suggest that I use for my background and profile picture when customising my system?</h3>

				<p>It’s up to you and how you want to appear to your potential guests, but a picture can paint a thousand words so choosing well is important. Ideally you are trying to show off yourself and your accommodation, and show that your guests will receive a warm friendly welcome. The pictures should try to align with your website. You might want to try a few and see what works best, or ask us or your friends to help.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3> Do your monthly fees include VAT?</h3>

				<p class="centre-block">Yes.</p>
			</div>



			<div class="span8 offset2 question">
				<h3>My business is in the United States. Can I use your service?</h3>

If you would like to be informed of when the roll out happens please send us your contact details at mail@thebedbooker.com  and we’ll keep in touch with you.</p>
