					<p>At the end of the sign up process you will be given your unique <strong>BookYourBeds</strong>.com web address also referred to as a URL. If you have a web designer who created your website for you, ask them to create a link on your website such as a ‘book now’ button and link it with your unique URL provided, or replace an ‘enquire’ button to link to your new URL rather than an existing enquiry form.  It’s quick, and easy! </p> 

					<p>If you have designed or are designing your website yourself using an online website builder, there should be instructions on how to add a link(s), on the website builder’s own website. If not, contact them directly to find out how to do this.</p>
